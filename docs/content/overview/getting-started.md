title: Mollitia - Overview - Getting Started

# Getting Started

Best is to check out the documentation and see what you need. But you are already doing that.

Then go play with the **[Playground](/playground)** to get a hand on circuit and module behaviors.

After that, install `Mollitia` on you project like this:

``` bash
# Install the dependency
npm install mollitia --save
```

And start hacking. Happy coding!
